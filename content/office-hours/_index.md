## About Office Hours

Our weekly sessions are dedicated to discussing Rust in production environments. We provide an open forum where participants can ask questions, share their experiences, and learn from one another about using Rust in real-world applications. These Office Hours also offer a valuable opportunity to connect with fellow Rust developers, fostering a community of practitioners who are working with or interested in Rust for production systems.
