# Ship On Day One

Amidst a sea of Rust learning material, it's time for something genuinely
engaging and rewarding. 

We hand-crafted two Rust workshops with the goal of getting you to ship code as
quickly as possible. We go beyond the typical "Hello World" examples and teach you
the ropes of Rust as you build real applications from day one.

Hoist your sails and set course for Rust!

## Our Workshops

"**Learning Rust by Counting Words**" isn’t just another basic Rust
workshop. We show how you can write a useful program in Rust fast while following
the best practices of the Rust community.
You'll learn how to structure your code, how to handle errors, how to test your
code, and how Rust can help you avoid common pitfalls. Almost playfully, you'll learn
the fundamentals of Rust, and you'll be able to confidently write your own
programs with Rust shortly after.

"**Write Yourself a Shell in Rust**" takes you one step further. 
Throughout the workshop, you'll build a fully functional shell from scratch that
you can extend and customize to your liking. You'll learn advanced concepts like
lifetimes, parsing user input, and spawning processes. We leverage the Rust type
system to build powerful and ergonomic abstractions that are both safe and easy
to use. 

## What Makes Our Workshops Special?

* We use a live mentorship model, not passive learning. You’ll be guided by
  experienced Rust developers who will support you every step of the way.
* Each workshop is split up into two half-day sessions, where we will go through the
  material together, give you time to work on the exercises, and answer your
  questions along the way.
* You will also have access to a dedicated chat channel for each
  workshop, where you can ask questions and share ideas with your fellow students.
* On top of that, you will have access to the workshop material and slides as well as
  a test suite that you can use to check your solutions.
* We focus on practical projects, not theoretical knowledge. You’ll build
  real-world applications from day one.
* We teach you how to use patterns and techniques that are unique to Rust, like
  ownership, error handling, pattern matching, and more.
* The standard library will be our best friend. We won't need any external
  crates. You will learn how to build the abstractions yourself and how they
  work. This will give you a solid grasp of the underlying concepts.
  On top of that, this ensures that you won't have to deal with outdated
  dependencies or breaking changes in the future.

## This Workshop is for You If...

* You like to learn by doing.
* You get a boost of motivation from projects with a short feedback loop.
* A hands-on approach is more appealing to you than reading a book.
* You enjoy working on real-world projects.
* You're motivated when other people around you learn as well (library effect).
* You want a jumpstart into the Rust ecosystem.
* You want to learn how to write idiomatic Rust code.

## What You'll Get

By the end of your journey with us, you’ll have a functional project that you
developed yourself and can be proud of. A testament to your hard work that you
can build upon.

You will get a solid understanding of Rust and its unique features and
will be able to apply them to your own projects.

All participants will receive a certificate of completion.
