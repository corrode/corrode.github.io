# Ship From Day One

Amidst a sea of Rust learning material, it's time for something genuinely
engaging and rewarding. 

We hand-crafted new Rust workshops with the goal of getting you to ship code as
quickly as possible. We go beyond the typical "Hello World" examples and teach
you the ropes of Rust as you build real applications from day one.

Hoist your sails and set course for Rust!

## What Makes Our Workshops Special?

* We use a live mentorship model, not passive learning. You’ll be guided by
  experienced Rust developers who will support you every step of the way.
* Each workshop is split up into two half-day sessions, where we will go through
  the material together, give you time to work on the exercises, and answer your
  questions along the way.
* You will also have access to a dedicated chat channel for each workshop, where
  you can ask questions and share ideas with your fellow students.
* You will have access to the workshop material and slides as
  well as a test suite that you can use to check your solutions.
* Throughout the workshop, you will have the chance to ask questions and get
  feedback on your code.
* We focus on practical projects, not theoretical knowledge. You’ll build
  real-world applications from day one.
* We teach you how to use patterns and techniques that are unique to Rust, like
  ownership, error handling, pattern matching, and more.
* The standard library will be our best friend. We won't need any external
  crates. You will learn how to build the abstractions yourself and how they
  work. This will give you a solid grasp of the underlying concepts. On top of
  that, this ensures that you won't have to deal with outdated dependencies or
  breaking changes in the future.

## This Workshop is for You If...

* You like to learn by doing.
* You get a boost of motivation from projects with a short feedback loop.
* A hands-on approach is more appealing to you than reading a book.
* You enjoy working on real-world projects.
* You're motivated when other people around you learn alongside you.
* You want a jumpstart into the Rust ecosystem.
* You want to learn how to write idiomatic Rust code.

## Expected Outcomes and Benefits

By the end of your journey with us, you’ll have a functional project that you
developed yourself and can be proud of. A testament to your hard work that you
can build upon.

You will get a solid understanding of Rust and its unique features and will be
able to apply them to your own projects. From the beginning, you will learn how
to set up your project to make it easier to test.

All participants will receive a certificate of completion.
