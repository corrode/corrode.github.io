I wrote a checklist to help companies find and onboard Rust talent, 
because I saw many organizations make the same mistakes when hiring Rust developers.
If you are a hiring manager or a team lead looking to hire Rust developers, this guide is for you.

## Is Your Company Ready? 

Before you even start looking for Rust developers, ask yourself: "Is my company prepared for the hiring process"?

- Do you already have enough skilled people to evaluate Rust candidates? 
- Have you prepared for any required training or adjustments in workflows to accommodate Rust talent?
- Experienced Rust developers are not cheap. Are you prepared to offer competitive salaries and benefits such as remote work?

Fix those issues before you start looking for Rust developers.

## Setting Expectations

#### Avoid Unrealistic Demands

Don't expect 10 years of Rust experience, as Rust is a relatively new language. (Rust 1.0 was released in 2015.)
Such exaggerated expectations can significantly (and unnecessarily) narrow your pool of potential candidates. Experienced developers might consider this a red flag as it shows a lack of understanding of the Rust ecosystem.

Instead, it might be enough to look for the *willingness* to learn Rust or, at most, non-production experience with the language.

#### Clearly Specify Tasks and Responsibilities

Will the candidate have to work with other languages or technologies?
Which crates will they use?
Outline the specific tasks and responsibilities that involve Rust.
This helps candidates understand what is expected of them and which other ecosystems they might need to interact with. 

## Finding Candidates

The Rust job market is still relatively small compared to languages like Python or JavaScript.

Currently, the best way to find Rust devs is through your network. From experience, you probably won't have a lot of trouble finding interested candidates as many developers are trying to move into Rust.

There are also some Rust-specific job boards like [RustJobs.dev](https://rustjobs.dev/) and [RustJobs.fyi](https://www.rustjobs.fyi/), and boards with a dedicated Rust section,
like [Filtra.io](https://filtra.io/rust) and [RemoteOK](https://remoteok.com/remote-rust-jobs).
You can also post on the "who is hiring" threads on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/182f6dv/official_rrust_whos_hiring_thread_for_jobseekers/).

If you're looking for senior people or require a bigger pool of candidates, you might want to consider sponsoring Rust events, conferences, or [podcasts](/podcast).

## Evaluating Candidates

Here are a few positive traits to look for when evaluating Rust candidates. 
These skills can be evaluated for every level of experience, from junior to senior Rust developers.

* **Systems Understanding:** A strong grasp of fundamental concepts such as heap vs. stack memory, threading, and data structures is a good indicator of a candidate's ability to work productively with Rust.

* **Rust Reasoning:** For those without Rust experience, test their ability to reason about Rust code. Provide sample Rust code and ask them to explain what it does. Ask clarifying questions to gauge their interest and to see how quickly they can learn.

* **Adaptability:** Look for candidates who have a proven track record to quickly adapt and learn new technologies. Rust's ecosystem is rapidly evolving, and flexibility is key.

* **Related Languages:** Be open to candidates transitioning from C++, Java, Kotlin, or TypeScript, which have an equally strong emphasis on enterprise-grade software development. Haskell, OCaml, and other functional programming languages can also be a good fit, because of their focus on the type system and correctness. Rust has [functional aspects](/blog/paradigms/), which are similar to these languages. 

* **Open Source Contributions:** Some candidates might have a strong background in open source work. Go through their contributions to assess code quality and communication style. 

* **Industry and Domain Knowledge:** Consider candidates with experience in Rust's key domains, such as backend development, infrastructure, real-time data processing, and systems programming. Depending on your niche, assess their expertise in these areas.

* **Evaluate Troubleshooting Skills:** A good proxy for Rust knowledge is the ability to debug and reason about code in general. Assess a candidates' ability to understand and resolve compile errors in Rust, focusing on common issues with ownership and borrowing. Provide scenarios that require light debugging and refactoring of Rust code.

* **Ask to use the Rust documentation** Rust takes documentation seriously. Show candidates some Rust documentation and ask follow-up questions to gauge their ability to understand basic concepts. 

## Support Your New Hires

Once you've hired Rust developers, it's time to invest in their long-term success. Here are a few ways to support your new hires:

1. Provide access to resources such as books, online courses, and internal knowledge-sharing sessions.
2. Encourage attendance and talks at Rust conferences, meetups, and workshops. This helps keep your team feel like a part of the broader Rust community
and stay updated on the latest developments and best practices in the Rust ecosystem.
3. Support contributions to open source projects. This can help improve the broader Rust ecosystem and become a way for your team to learn from others.

Good luck with your Rust hiring process! If you have any questions or need further advice, feel free to reach out.
