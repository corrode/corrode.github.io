Hiring Rust developers requires strategic planning. This guide offers a comprehensive checklist to help companies find and onboard Rust talent, drawing on my experience as a Rust consultant and insights from working with diverse companies.

## Company Readiness

Before you even start looking for Rust developers, ask yourself: "Is my company prepared for the hiring process"?

- Do you have enough skilled people to evaluate Rust candidates? 
- Have you prepared for any required training or adjustments in workflows to accommodate Rust development?
- Rust developers are not cheap. Are you prepared to offer competitive salaries and benefits such as remote work?

## Set Realistic Experience Requirements

**Avoid Unrealistic Demands:** Avoid setting unrealistic demands for 5-10 years of Rust experience, as Rust is a relatively new language. Such expectations can significantly (and unnecessarily) narrow your pool of potential candidates. It might be enough to look for the willingness to learn Rust or, at most, non-production experience with the language.

**Specify Tasks and Responsibilities:**
Will the candidate have to work with other languages or technologies?
Clearly outline the specific tasks and responsibilities that involve Rust. This helps candidates understand what is expected of them and which other ecosystems they might need to interact with. 

**Focus on Related Skills:** Emphasize overall programming and software design experience, which can often translate well to Rust. More on this below.

## Evaluating Candidates

Here are a few positive traits to look for when evaluating Rust candidates: 

* **Systems Understanding:** A strong grasp of fundamental concepts such as heap vs. stack memory, threading, and data structures is a good indicator of a candidate's ability to work productively with Rust.


* **Rust Reasoning:** For those without Rust experience, test their ability to reason about Rust code. Provide sample Rust code and ask them to explain what it does. Ask clarifying questions to gauge their interest and how quickly they can learn.

* **Adaptability:** Look for candidates who have a proven track record to quickly adapt and learn new technologies. Rust's ecosystem is rapidly evolving, and flexibility is key.

* **Related Languages:** Be open to candidates transitioning from C++, Java, Kotlin, or TypeScript, which have an equally strong emphasis on enterprise-grade software development. Haskell, OCaml, and other functional programming languages can also be a good fit, because of their focus on the type system and correctness. Rust has [functional aspects](/blog/paradigms/), which are similar to these languages. 

* **Open Source Contributions:** Some candidates might have a strong background in open source work. Go through their contributions to assess code quality and communication style. 

* **Industry and Domain Knowledge:** Consider candidates with experience in Rust's key domains, such as backend development, infrastructure, real-time data processing, and systems programming. Depending on your niche, assess their expertise in areas like real-time data processing, cryptography, performance-critical applications, or embedded systems.

* **Evaluate Troubleshooting Skills:** A good proxy for Rust knowledge is the ability to debug and reason about code in general. Assess candidates' ability to understand and resolve compile errors in Rust, focusing on common issues like ownership and borrowing. Provide scenarios that require debugging and optimization of Rust code.

* **Ask to use the Rust documentation** Rust takes documentation seriously. Show candidates some Rust documentation and ask follow-up questions to gauge their ability to understand and apply it. 

## Job Market and Networking

The Rust job market is still relatively small compared to languages like Python or JavaScript. Nevertheless, many developers are planning to use Rust at work. 

There are some Rust-specific job boards like [RustJobs.dev](https://rustjobs.dev/) and [RustJobs.fyi](https://www.rustjobs.fyi/), and boards with a dedicated Rust section,
like [Filtra.io](https://filtra.io/rust) and [RemoteOK](https://remoteok.com/remote-rust-jobs).
You can also post on the "who is hiring" threads on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/182f6dv/official_rrust_whos_hiring_thread_for_jobseekers/).

An alternative is to actively network within the Rust community to find potential candidates. You can do so, by sponsoring Rust events and conferences.
Feel free to reach out to me if you need help finding Rust developers. I can provide insights and possibly connect you with suitable candidates.

## Continuous Improvement

Once Rust developers are hired, support their growth and integration within your team:

Encourage attendance at Rust conferences, meetups, and workshops. This helps keep your team updated on the latest developments and best practices in the Rust ecosystem.
Promote continuous learning and improvement in Rust programming practices. Provide access to resources such as books, online courses, and internal knowledge-sharing sessions.

Good luck with your Rust hiring process! If you have any feedback or questions, feel free to reach out to me.
