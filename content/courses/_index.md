# Ship From Day One

In a sea of Rust courses, many offer quick, low-effort content. But you deserve
better! You're worth a course that is truly fun and pushes you to your limits.

Our courses are meticulously crafted, not just to teach Rust,
but to immerse you in building your first real-world application that goes beyond
of the usual "Hello World" examples.

The course material is designed to help you ship code as early as possible
and learn Rust along the way.

## Our Courses

"**Learning Rust by Counting Words**" isn’t just another basic programming
course. We show you what makes Rust special, and why trivial programs can be
challenging to write correctly. Almost playfully, you'll learn the fundamentals
of Rust, and you'll be able to confidently write your own programs with Rust in
the future.

"**Write Yourself a Shell in Rust**" takes you one step further. 
You'll learn advanced Rust concepts, and you'll build a fully functional shell
from scratch. 
This course challenges and inspires, making the learning process not only
educational but genuinely enjoyable.

## What Makes Our Courses Different?

* We use a live mentorship model, not passive learning. You’ll be guided by
  experienced Rust developers who will help you learn and grow.
  We will have two half-day sessions for each course, where we will go through
  the material and answer your questions. You will also have access to a
  dedicated Discord channel for each course, where you can ask questions and
  discuss with your fellow students. On top of that, you will have access to
  the course material and slides as well as a test suite that you can use to
  check your solutions.
* We focus on practical projects, not theoretical knowledge. You’ll build real
  applications from day one.
* We teach you how to use patterns and techniques that are unique to Rust.
* The standard library will be our best friend. No external crates, no
  magic. You will learn how to build the abstractions yourself and how they
  work. This will give you confidence and a better understanding of the
  underlying concepts.

## Why Settle for Less?

Forget passive learning and cookie-cutter courses. Our interactive, live
mentorship model keeps you focused and engaged. You’re not just learning Rust;
you're having fun and you'll want to keep going.

By the end of your journey with us, you won’t just have theoretical knowledge or
demo code. You’ll have a functional project that you built yourself and can
proudly showcase. A testament to your hard work that you can be proud of.
