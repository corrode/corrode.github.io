# Ship On Day One

Amidst a sea of Rust courses, it's time for something genuinely engaging and
rewarding. 

All our courses are meticulously hand-crafted, not just to teach you Rust,
but to immerse you in building your first real-world application from day one.
We go beyond the usual "Hello World" examples and teach you the ropes of Rust
without you even noticing.

Our interactive course material is designed to help you ship code as early as
possible. Hoist your sails and set course for Rust!

## Our Courses

"**Learning Rust by Counting Words**" isn’t just another basic Rust
course. We show how you can write a useful program in Rust from day one and follow
the best practices of the Rust community.
You'll learn how to structure your code, how to handle errors, how to test your
code, and how Rust can help you avoid common pitfalls. Almost playfully, you'll learn
the fundamentals of Rust, and you'll be able to confidently write your own
programs with Rust shortly after.

"**Write Yourself a Shell in Rust**" takes you one step further. 
You'll learn advanced concepts like lifetimes, parsing user input, and process
management. We leverage the Rust type system to build powerful and ergonomic
abstractions that are safe and easy to use. Throughout the course, you'll build
a fully functional shell from scratch that you can extend and customize to your
liking.

## What Makes Our Courses Special?

* We use a live mentorship model, not passive learning. You’ll be guided by
  experienced Rust developers who will support you every step of the way.
* Each course is split up into two half-day sessions, where we will go through the
  material together, give you time to work on the exercises, and answer your
  questions along the way.
* You will also have access to a dedicated Discord channel for each
  course, where you can ask questions and discuss with your fellow students.
* On top of that, you will have access to the course material and slides as well as
  a test suite that you can use to check your solutions.
* We focus on practical projects, not theoretical knowledge. You’ll build
  real-world applications from day one.
* We teach you how to use patterns and techniques that are unique to Rust, like
  ownership, error handling, pattern matching, and more.
* The standard library will be our best friend. We won't need any external
  crates. You will learn how to build the abstractions yourself and how they
  work. This will give you a solid grasp of the underlying concepts.
  On top of that, this ensures that you won't have to deal with outdated
  dependencies or breaking changes in the future.

## What You'll Get

By the end of your journey with us, you won’t just have theoretical knowledge or
demo code. You’ll have a functional project that you developed yourself and can
be proud of. A testament to your hard work that you can build upon.

Our interactive, live mentorship model keeps you focused
and engaged. You’re not just learning Rust; you're having fun and you'll want to
keep going.
