## Learn Rust through fun, practical projects.

In a sea of Rust courses, many offer quick, low-effort content. But you deserve
better. You're worth a course that truly values your time.

We believe in creating something more substantial,
more motivating. Our courses are meticulously crafted, not just to teach Rust,
but to immerse you in building real-world applications that go beyond of what you
thought you were capable of.

"**Learning Rust by Counting Words**" isn’t just another basic programming course.
We show you what makes Rust special, and why even trivial programs can be
challenging to write correctly. Along the way, you'll learn the fundamentals of
Rust, and you'll be able to confidently write your own programs with Rust in the
future.

"**Write Yourself a Shell in Rust**" takes you further. This isn’t just about
learning system programming; it’s about creating a shell you can use, extend,
and be proud of. This course challenges and inspires, making the learning
process not only educational but genuinely enjoyable.

## What Makes Our Courses Different?

* We use a live mentorship model, not passive learning. You’ll be guided by
  experienced Rust developers who will help you learn and grow.
* We focus on practical projects, not theoretical knowledge. You’ll build real
  applications from day one.
* We teach you how to use patterns and techniques that are unique to Rust.
* The standard library will be our best friend. No external crates, no
magic.

## Why Settle for Less?

Forget passive learning and cookie-cutter courses. Our interactive, live
mentorship model keeps you focused and engaged. You’re not just learning Rust;
you're having fun and you'll want to keep going.

By the end of your journey with us, you won’t just have theoretical knowledge or
demo code. You’ll have a functional project that you built yourself and can
showcase with pride. A testament to your hard work that you can be proud of.

Of course, you can find cheaper online courses (and if you're unable to afford our
courses, please contact us and we'll see what we can do).
However, we think that you shouldn't be compromising on quality. Time is
precious, and you want to hit the ground running.
