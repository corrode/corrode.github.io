  <details class="faq-item">
    <summary>Why a dedicated Rust expert?</summary>
    <p>Haven't you ever been to a restaurant that serves everything from sushi to pizza? How does that make you feel about the quality of the food? The same applies to software development. A generalist might be able to help you with many things, but they won't be able to provide the same level of expertise as a specialist.</p>
    <p>If you want sushi or pizza, I can recommend a great place around DÃ¼sseldorf, but for Rust, you're in the right place!</p>
  </details>
