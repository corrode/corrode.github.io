## Here’s the problem...

Rust is a complex language with a large API surface. Writing production-grade Rust requires a lot of architectural decisions. As a team lead excited about Rust, you're responsible for your project's success.
Your team wants to do things right, but lacks experience, and you're trying to reduce risk.

Courses alone won't cut it. Nameless agencies offer help, but they don't care about your project or team.
Worse, they might even lead you down the wrong path because they lack real experience.
Contract devs can hurt engineering culture and create  knowledge silos.
You're stuck, afraid of making the wrong move.

## There Must Be a Better Way...

What you need is to move forward with **confidence**. You want excellent Rust that's robust, testable, quick to compile, and easy for your team to extend. You want Rust projects that are a joy to work with.

**Your teams will spend thousands of hours maintaining Rust services. Invest the time to learn how to do it well.**
**Don't struggle alone; get a mentor.**
**Together we'll build a codebase you'll love working with and feel confident maintaining yourself.**

## Why Me?

The right mentor can make all the difference. 

I offer **friendly, human-centered** mentoring based on a decade of Rust experience and dozens of production success stories.
I provide support for teams who care.

My training helps you get Rust to production in half the time and brings your team up to speed in 2 months instead of 4.
It's the training which prepares you for the years to come, teaching you how to write Rust code **well**... and then getting out of your way.
I'll help you navigate the Rust crate ecosystem, systems architecture, code reviews, and idiomatic Rust.

        Have you ever been to a restaurant that serves everything from sushi to pizza? How does that make you feel about the quality of the food? The same applies to software development. A generalist might be able to help you with many things, but they won't be able to provide the same level of expertise as a specialist.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want sushi or pizza, I can recommend a great place around Düsseldorf, but I can help with Rust!
    </p>
  </details>

  <details class="faq-item">

    </p>
  </details>

  <details class="faq-item">
    <summary>What is your main area of expertise within Rust?</summary>
    <p>
        My main strength lies in backend systems, APIs, command-line tooling, and DevOps. I have extensive experience building high-performance, scalable systems in Rust, and delivering robust and efficient solutions. I also specialize in helping teams adopt Rust, providing training, code reviews, and ongoing support to ensure successful integration of Rust into your tech stack.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details class="faq-item">
    <summary>How do you specialize in bringing teams to production with Rust?</summary>
    <p>
        From experience, I learned that a lot of developers are excited about Rust and might even have started a project with it. However, they often struggle to bring it to production. This entails a lot of challenges, such as setting up a CI/CD pipeline, structuring the codebase, and dependency management.
    </p>
    <p>
        My expertise lies in guiding teams through the entire process of adopting Rust and deploying it to production. This includes initial strategy, architecture design, implementation, testing, and deployment. I focus on backend systems and APIs, ensuring they're robust, efficient, and scalable. My approach combines hands-on development with knowledge transfer, enabling your team to maintain and expand the system independently.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What if we're new to Rust?</summary>
      <p>
          That's perfectly fine! I specialize in helping teams adopt Rust. We can start with training sessions and gradually move into more hands-on development as your team's comfort with Rust grows.
      </p>
  </details>

  <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Can you help with an existing Rust project?</summary>
      <p>
          Absolutely! Whether you need help optimizing an existing codebase, expanding functionality, or conducting code reviews, I can assist with projects at any stage of development.

    </p>
    <p>
        That said, I work best with small, focused groups. My ideal group size is 3-10 people, typically towards the lower end of that range. This allows for more personalized attention and effective knowledge transfer. If you have larger teams, we can arrange multiple sessions with smaller groups to ensure everyone gets the most out of our time together.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>How long does a typical project last?</summary>
      <p>
          Project durations vary based on scope and complexity. Typically, engagements range from a few weeks for focused tasks to several months for more comprehensive projects. We'll discuss timelines during our initial consultation.
      </p>
  </details>

  <details class="faq-item">
