Hi, I'm <strong>Matthias Endler</strong>, a Rust developer and open-source maintainer with 10 years of Rust experience. 

I help clients worldwide get the most out of Rust through training and consulting.
I like no-frills, easy-to-follow, [idiomatic Rust](/blog) code.

**But code is rarely the most important part!**

Software development is a team effort, and I'll ensure that you and your colleagues feel heard and have a great experience working with me.
I deeply care about the people I work with. 

Don't take my word for it. Here's what <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drernie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Ernest</a> from
<a href="https://www.quiltdata.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Quilt</a> has to say: 

> Matthias was a godsend for our team. We had a legacy codebase written while we were first learning Rust and didn’t even know how to think clearly about best practices. He didn’t fix the code for us; he created a safe space for us to learn how to fix it ourselves. His patient mentorship and vulnerable engagement accelerated the maturity of both our codebase and our developers.
