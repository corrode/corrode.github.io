Hi, I'm Matthias Endler, a Rust developer and open source maintainer. 
I've built popular Rust crates like [tinysearch](https://github.com/tinysearch/tinysearch), [hyperjson](https://github.com/mre/hyperjson), and [lychee](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee).

You might have seen me speaking at conferences such as [FOSDEM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePiWBGh35q0) in Brussels, 
[Cod{e}motion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imtejBNbm0o) in Amsterdam, and
[BrisTech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEcbTYLtLSM) in Bristol.
I've also given workshops at [emBO++](https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/235) in Bochum,
[RustBeltRust](https://speakerdeck.com/mre/workshop-write-your-own-shell-in-rust) in Columbus, OH and [RustFest](https://hackmd.io/ru4intliRlyJ9t8pU2F29A) Barcelona.

I'm passionate about [Idiomatic Rust](https://github.com/mre/idiomatic-rust) and I love to [blog](https://endler.dev/).

With my solid knowledge around performance optimizations, scalability, concurrent- and parallel execution and WebAssembly, I help clients around the world to get the most out of Rust.

Feel free to [get in contact](mailto:hi@corrode.dev) with me, I'm always up for a chat!
