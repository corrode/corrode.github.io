Hi, I'm <strong>Matthias Endler</strong>, a Rust developer and open-source maintainer with 20 years of experience in software development.

I help clients worldwide get the most out of Rust through training, consulting, and writing no-frills, easy-to-follow, [idiomatic Rust](/blog) code.

But code is rarely the most important part! I deeply care about the people I work with. Software development is a team effort, and I'll ensure that you and your colleagues feel heard and have a great experience working with me.

Don't take my word for it. Here's what <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drernie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Ernest</a> from
<a href="https://www.quiltdata.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Quilt</a> recently had to say: 

> Matthias was a godsend for our team. We had a legacy codebase written while we were first learning Rust and didn’t even know how to think clearly about best practices. He didn’t fix the code for us; he created a safe space for us to learn how to fix it ourselves. His patient mentorship and vulnerable engagement accelerated the maturity of both our codebase and our developers.

## Impact

Here are some of the ways I've helped clients in the past:

- Consistently positive feedback from workshop participants
- Smooth team augmentation, helping companies accelerate their Rust adoption
- Proactive problem-solving, saving clients from potential roadblocks and headaches. They avoid going down the wrong path and can focus on what matters
- On average, I help teams save about 2 months of Rust training time per developer

## Here's How It Works

First, we'll have a chat to understand your needs and goals. I'll ask many very basic questions to get the full picture.

Based on that, I'll provide you with a high-level overview of what I think we should do. If you're happy with what you hear, we'll decide on a plan together. The priority is to get some quick wins to build momentum. Along the way, you can expect me to communicate clearly and get everyone on the same page &mdash; regardless of their Rust experience. 

## Why Me?

Unlike many agencies, I focus *exclusively* on Rust.

I have been deeply involved in the Rust community since 2015 and truly love the language, its community, and its ecosystem. Since 2019, I have shipped actual Rust services to production for small and large companies, and I can help you do the same!

## Why a Dedicated Rust Specialist?

Have you ever been to a restaurant that serves everything from sushi to pizza? How does that make you feel about the quality of the food? The same applies to software development. A generalist might be able to help you with many things, but they won't be able to provide the same level of expertise as a specialist.

If you want sushi or pizza, I can recommend a great place around Düsseldorf, but for Rust, you're in the right place!

So what does a dedicated Rust specialist bring to the table?

As your Rust consultant, I offer:
- Deep expertise in Rust's unique features and best practices
- Up-to-date knowledge of the best Rust crates and new developments
- Tailored solutions that leverage Rust's strengths for your specific needs

You can work with an agency for Rust development, but you might never be sure if they're truly Rust experts or just fitting Rust into their existing toolbox. With me, you know you're getting a dedicated Rust specialist who loves the language and uses it every day.

## What You Need to Know

Before we begin, there’s something important you should know. I fully support my clients and their projects. My focus is on delivering a superior customer experience. I only take on projects when I’m confident I can help you succeed. That’s why I offer a free initial consultation to ensure we’re a good fit.

If you're interested in working together, please [get in touch](mailto:hi@corrode.dev) or [schedule a call with me](https://cal.com/corrode).

## My Approach

I believe in a collaborative, pragmatic, and educational approach to consulting. Here's what that means for you:

- Collaborative: I work closely with your team, adapting to your workflow
- Pragmatic: I focus on practical solutions that deliver real value
- Educational: I ensure your team grows stronger with every project

## How Do I Know You're Any Good?

I am a passionate open-source maintainer. Some popular Rust crates I built are [tinysearch](https://github.com/tinysearch/tinysearch), [hyperjson](https://github.com/mre/hyperjson), and [lychee](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee). My projects are used by companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon and integrated into more than 10,000 repositories. 

If you want to check how I communicate, check out my [podcast](/podcast) where I talk to decision makers and lead engineers about Rust adoption in their companies.

You might have seen me speaking at conferences such as [FOSDEM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePiWBGh35q0) in Brussels, [Cod{e}motion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imtejBNbm0o) in Amsterdam, and [BrisTech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEcbTYLtLSM) in Bristol. I've also given workshops at [emBO++](https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/235) in Bochum, [RustBeltRust](https://speakerdeck.com/mre/workshop-write-your-own-shell-in-rust) in Columbus, OH, and [RustFest](https://hackmd.io/ru4intliRlyJ9t8pU2F29A) in Barcelona.
