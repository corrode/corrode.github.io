Hi, I'm Matthias Endler, a Rust developer and open source maintainer.
I love no-frills, easy-to-follow, [idiomatic Rust](https://github.com/mre/idiomatic-rust) code.

Some popular Rust crates that I built are [tinysearch](https://github.com/tinysearch/tinysearch),
[hyperjson](https://github.com/mre/hyperjson), and
[lychee](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee).
I'm a Rustacean since 2015 and I've been working with Rust professionally since 2019.

You might have seen me speaking at conferences such as
[FOSDEM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePiWBGh35q0) in Brussels, 
[Cod{e}motion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imtejBNbm0o) in Amsterdam, and
[BrisTech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEcbTYLtLSM) in Bristol. I've also
given workshops at [emBO++](https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/235) in
Bochum,
[RustBeltRust](https://speakerdeck.com/mre/workshop-write-your-own-shell-in-rust)
in Columbus, OH and [RustFest](https://hackmd.io/ru4intliRlyJ9t8pU2F29A)
Barcelona.

With my solid knowledge around performance optimizations, scalability,
concurrent- and parallel execution and WebAssembly, I help clients around the
world to get the most out of Rust through teaching, consulting, and
contracting.

Feel free to [get in contact](mailto:hi@corrode.dev) with me, I'm always up for
a chat!
