Hi, I'm <strong>Matthias Endler</strong>, a Rust developer and open-source maintainer with 20 years of experience in software development.

I help clients worldwide get the most out of Rust through training, consulting, and writing no-frills, easy-to-follow, [idiomatic Rust](/blog) code.

But code is rarely the most important part! I deeply care about the people I work with. Software development is a team effort, and I'll ensure that you and your colleagues feel heard and have a great experience working with me.

Don't take my word for it. Here's what <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drernie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Ernest</a> from
<a href="https://www.quiltdata.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Quilt</a> recently had to say: 

> Matthias was a godsend for our team. We had a legacy codebase written while we were first learning Rust and didn’t even know how to think clearly about best practices. He didn’t fix the code for us; he created a safe space for us to learn how to fix it ourselves. His patient mentorship and vulnerable engagement accelerated the maturity of both our codebase and our developers.

## Here's How It Works

First, we'll have a chat to understand your needs and goals. I'll ask many very basic questions to get the full picture.

Based on that, I'll provide you with a high-level overview of what I think we should do. If you're happy with what you hear, we'll decide on a plan together. The priority is to get some quick wins to build momentum. Along the way, you can expect me to communicate clearly and get everyone on the same page &mdash; regardless of their Rust experience. 

## Why Me?

Unlike many agencies, I focus *exclusively* on Rust.

I have been deeply involved in the Rust community since 2015 and truly love the language, its community, and its ecosystem. Since 2019, I have shipped actual Rust services to production for small and large companies, and I can help you do the same!

## What You Need to Know

Before we start, there's one thing you should know: 
I stand behind my clients and their projects. That means I won't take on a project if I don't believe I can help you succeed. That's why I offer a free initial consultation to make sure we're a good fit. 

If you're interested in working together, please [get in touch](mailto:hi@corrode.dev) or [schedule a call with me](https://cal.com/corrode).

## How Do I Know You're Any Good?

I am a passionate open-source maintainer. Some popular Rust crates I built are [tinysearch](https://github.com/tinysearch/tinysearch), [hyperjson](https://github.com/mre/hyperjson), and [lychee](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee). My projects are used by companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon and integrated into more than 10,000 repositories. 

You can learn more on [GitHub](https://github.com/mre) or my [personal website](https://endler.dev/). Reach out for references!

You might have seen me speaking at conferences such as [FOSDEM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePiWBGh35q0) in Brussels, [Cod{e}motion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imtejBNbm0o) in Amsterdam, and [BrisTech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEcbTYLtLSM) in Bristol. I've also given workshops at [emBO++](https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/235) in Bochum, [RustBeltRust](https://speakerdeck.com/mre/workshop-write-your-own-shell-in-rust) in Columbus, OH, and [RustFest](https://hackmd.io/ru4intliRlyJ9t8pU2F29A) in Barcelona.
