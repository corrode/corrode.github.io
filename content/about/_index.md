Hi, I'm <strong>Matthias Endler</strong>, a Rust developer and open source maintainer.

I support my clients around the world to get the most out of Rust through
training, consulting, and contracting with no-frills, easy-to-follow, [idiomatic
Rust](/blog) code.

In collaborating with me, you'll experience a comprehensive approach that
considers the broader impacts of modifications to your codebase. I prioritize
clear communication and thorough documentation. My approach is grounded in
systems thinking, ensuring that any changes we implement are not only robust but
also designed for long-term maintainability.

Some popular Rust crates that I built are [tinysearch](https://github.com/tinysearch/tinysearch),
[hyperjson](https://github.com/mre/hyperjson), and
[lychee](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee).
I'm a Rustacean since 2015 and I've been working with Rust professionally since 2019.

You might have seen me speaking at conferences such as
[FOSDEM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePiWBGh35q0) in Brussels,
[Cod{e}motion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imtejBNbm0o) in Amsterdam, and
[BrisTech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEcbTYLtLSM) in Bristol. I've also
given workshops at [emBO++](https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/235) in
Bochum,
[RustBeltRust](https://speakerdeck.com/mre/workshop-write-your-own-shell-in-rust)
in Columbus, OH and [RustFest](https://hackmd.io/ru4intliRlyJ9t8pU2F29A)
Barcelona.

You can learn more about me on [GitHub](https://github.com/mre) or on my
[personal website](https://endler.dev/).

Feel free to get in contact via [mail](mailto:hi@corrode.dev) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/endlermatthias/).
I'm always up for a chat!
