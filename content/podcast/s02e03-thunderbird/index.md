There are probably only a handful of open-source projects that had a bigger
impact on the world than Mozilla Thunderbird. The email client has been around
for over two decades and has been a staple for many users (me included).

Dealing with a legacy codebase that serves millions of users is no easy feat.
The team at MZLA, a subsidiary of Mozilla, has been working hard to modernize
the core of Thunderbird by writing new parts in Rust.

In this episode, I talk to Brendan Abolivier, a software engineer at MZLA, about
the challenges of working on a legacy codebase, the new Rust-based Exchange protocol support, which is the first new protocol in Thunderbird in over a decade, and the future of Thunderbird.
