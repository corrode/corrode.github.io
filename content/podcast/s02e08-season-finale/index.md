As we approach the finale of our second season, it's time for another recap.

Could we shed some light on the current state of Rust's usage in the industry?
What has changed in our perception of Rust in production since our last season?

While more companies started to embrace Rust, some of the magic of Rust's early days is gone.
I expect more ripple effects as the community clashes with the industry's demands.

This episode takes on a more somber tone, as we peer into the massive tech debt we have accumulated as an industry. 
And in the dark: a faint glow, a narrow golden path that points us towards a more hopeful future.
