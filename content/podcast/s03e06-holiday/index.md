While we try not to get too sentimental, celebrating one year of 'Rust in Production' alongside the holiday season feels like a perfect occasion to reflect. For this special episode of the podcast, we've gathered heartfelt messages from our guests to the Rust community.

There are two common themes that run through these messages:

* The importance of writing simple, approachable Rust code to help flatten the learning curve for newcomers
* Their gratitude for the vibrant ecosystem and the wealth of available crates

As we look ahead to the Rust 2024 edition, we're excited about what's to come. Thank you for being part of this journey with us, and here's to a great start to 2025! May the new year bring us all faster compile times, gentler learning curves, and, if we get lucky, let-chains on stable Rust.
