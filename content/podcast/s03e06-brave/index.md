Web browsers today face increasing demands for both performance and privacy. At Brave, they're tackling both challenges head-on with their Rust-based ad-blocking engine. This isn't just about blocking ads â€“ it's about doing so with minimal performance impact while maintaining compatibility with existing filter lists and adapting to evolving web technologies.

Today we're joined by Anton Lazarev, Senior Software Engineer at Brave, to discuss how they're using Rust to build a high-performance ad-blocker, the challenges of working within browser constraints, and how they're pushing the boundaries of what's possible in modern web privacy.
