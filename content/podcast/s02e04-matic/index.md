The idea of smart robots automating away boring household chores 
sounds enticing, yet these devices rarely work as advertised:
they get stuck, they break down, or are security nightmares.
And so it's refreshing to see a company like Matic taking a 
different approach by attempting to build truly smart, reliable,
and privacy-respecting robots. They use Rust for 95% of their codebase,
and use camera vision to navigate, vacuum, and mop floors.

I sit down with Eric Seppanen, Software Engineer at Matic, to learn
about vertical integration in robotics, on-device sensor processing,
large Rust codebases, and why Rust is a great language for the problem space.

### About Matic

Matic is on a mission to solve everyday problems with robotics.
Design Milk wrote in an [article about Matic](https://design-milk.com/matic-robot-vacuum-collects-dust-but-not-your-personal-data/): "Matic Robot Vacuum Collects Dust but Not Your Personal Data"
and I really love that quote. It's a great summary of what Matic is about:
privacy-respecting, truly smart robots.
The San Francisco-based startup recently raised a $24M Series A round.
