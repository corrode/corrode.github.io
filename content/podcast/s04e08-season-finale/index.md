It's time for another recap including our highlights of Season 4. 

We've been at this for a while now (four seasons, and 32 episodes to be exact).
We had guests from a wide range of industries: from Microsoft to Astral, and
from password managers to satellite systems. 

This time, it's all about using Rust for foundational software, which is
software that is critical to a team or even an entire organization. Rust is a
great fit for this type of software.
