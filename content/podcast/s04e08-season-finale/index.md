You know the drill by now. It's time for another recap!

Sit back, get a warm beverage and look back at the highlights of Season 4 with us. 

We've been at this for a while now (four seasons, and 32 episodes to be exact).
We had guests from a wide range of industries:
from Microsoft to Astral, and from password managers to satellite systems. 

Our focus this time around was on the technical details of Rust in production,
especially integration of Rust into existing codebases and ecosystem deep dives.
Thanks to everyone who participated in the survey last season, which helped us dial in our content.
Let us know if we hit the mark or missed it!

<!-- more -->

For the future, we hope to present an even more diverse set of guests and topics.
If you have any suggestions, please reach out!

We'll be back soon.
In the meantime, check out our dedicated [learn](/learn) page for additional content about Rust adoption.
