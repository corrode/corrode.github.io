Few developers have been as influential to my career as Niko Matsakis.
Of course he is a world-class engineer with a PhD from ETH ZÃ¼rich, a Rust core maintainer who has been
working on the language for way more than a decade, and a Senior Principal Engineer at AWS.
But more importantly, he is an empathetic human and an exceptional communicator.

I've personally been waiting for one year to get him on the show and steal one hour of his
precious time. Now, finally, I got my chance at live recording at Rust Week 2025.
The result is everything I hoped for: a trip down memory lane which takes us back 
to the early days of Rust, an honest and personal look at Rust's strengths and weaknesses, and a glimpse into the future of the language.
All of that packed with insightful anecdotes based on Niko's decades of experience.
If you like Rust, you will enjoy this episode.

## Show Notes

### About Rust

Rust is the language which brought us all together.
What started as a side-project of Graydon Hoare, a single developer at Mozilla, has grown into 
a worldwide community of hobbyists, professionals, and companies which all share the same goal:
to build better, safer software paired with great ergonomics and performance.

### About Niko Matsakis 

Niko is a long-time Rust core team member, having joined the project in 2012.
He was and still is part of the team which designed and implemented Rust's borrow checker,
which is the language's most important feature.
He has been a voice of reason and a guiding light for many of us, including myself.
His insightful talks and blog posts have helped countless developers to see the language and its goals in a new light.
