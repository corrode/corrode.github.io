Version control is a critical part of any modern software project
and git is the most popular tool for the job. But it can be complex and
confusing, especially for beginners.

The team behind GitButler believes there is a better way.

They are building a modern Git client that streamlines the process
of managing branches, backing up your work, and more. We hear from co-founders
Scott Chacon and Kiril Videlov about how they're making Git easier for everyone
-- all without sacrificing the power and flexibility that makes Git so popular in
the first place.
