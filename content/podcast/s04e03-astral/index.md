Up until a few years ago, Python tooling was a nightmare:
basic tasks like installing packages or managing Python versions was a pain.
The tools were brittle and did not work well together.

Then, suddenly, we saw a renaissance of new ideas in the Python ecosystem.
It started with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) and
continued with tooling written in Rust like [rye](https://rye.astral.sh/), which later got incorporated into 
[Astral](https://astral.sh/).

Astral in particular contributed a very important piece to the puzzle: `uv`
-- an extremely fast Python package and project manager that supersedes all previous attempts;
For example, it is 10x-100x faster than pip.
