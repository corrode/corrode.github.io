Up until a few years ago, Python tooling was a nightmare:
basic tasks like installing packages or managing Python versions was a pain.
The tools were brittle and did not work well together,
mired in a swamp of underspecified implementation defined behaviour.

Then, apparently suddenly, but in reality backed by years of ongoing work on formal interoperability specifications,
we saw a renaissance of new ideas in the Python ecosystem.
It started with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) and continued with tooling written in Rust like [rye](https://rye.astral.sh/), which later got incorporated into 
[Astral](https://astral.sh/).

Astral in particular contributed a very important piece to the puzzle: `uv`
-- an extremely fast Python package and project manager that supersedes all previous attempts;
For example, it is 10x-100x faster than pip.

In this episode I talk to Charlie Marsh, the Founder and CEO of Astral.
We talk about Astral's mission and how Rust plays an important role in it.

## Show Notes

### About Astral

Astral is a company that builds tools for Python developers.
What sounds simple is actually a very complex problem:
Python's ecosystem is huge, but fragmented and often incompatible.
Astralâ€™s mission is to make the Python ecosystem more productive by building high-performance developer tools, starting with Ruff.
In their words: "Fast, unified, futuristic."

### About Charlie Marsh 

Charlie is a long-time open source developer and entrepreneur.
He has an impressive CV, graduating with highest honors from Princeton University.
After that, he worked at Khan Academy and others before eventually founding Astral in '22.
Charlie is an engaging speaker and a great communicator.
