Imagine you're faced with the challenge to build a system that can handle billions of recyclable items per year
with the goal of being better than a human at identifying what can be recycled. 
Material classification is a complex problem that requires a lot of data and a lot of processing power
and it is a cutting-edge field of research.

Carters Schultz and his colleagues at AMP chose Rust to build the core of this system &mdash; and it worked "shockingly well".
In this interview, Carter, charismatic and witty, shares his experience of getting your hands dirty with Rust,
and building a cutting-edge production-ready system, which can be now replicated across the world.
