Programmers start counting at zero, and we follow this convention.
Introducing "Rust in Production", a podcast about companies who use Rust to shape
the future of infrastructure.
We're starting with a bang: In the first episode we will talk to Paul Dix, founder and CTO of
[InfluxData](https://www.influxdata.com/), about how the company rewrote the
core of their time series database in Rust.
Stay tuned! We will release the first episode on December 1st and then weekly
episodes every Thursday.
