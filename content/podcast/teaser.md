here are a lot of awesome podcasts about Rust.
We loved listening to [New Rustacean](https://newrustacean.com/)
and are excited about the new [Rustacean Station](https://rustacean-station.org/) and
[Rustship](https://www.marcoieni.com/2023/08/rustship-a-new-rust-podcast/) 
episodes. But we felt that there is a gap in the Rust podcast landscape: We
wanted to hear more about how companies use Rust in production.

So we decided to sit down and create the content we wanted to listen to. We
interviewed people from companies that use Rust in production and asked them
the tough questions that you want to hear answered but never get the chance to
ask:

* Why did they choose Rust?
* What are the real challenges of using Rust in production?
* How did your team get up to speed with Rust?
* Did you notice any performance improvements?

These and other questions are top of mind for developers and decision makers
who are considering Rust for their next project. We want to help them
understand the benefits and challenges of using Rust in production before
they head down that path. 

And we're starting with a bang: In the
first episode we will talk to Paul Dix, founder and CTO of
[InfluxData](https://www.influxdata.com/), about how the company rewrote the
core of their time series database in Rust. Stay tuned! We will release the
first episode on December 1st and then weekly episodes every Thursday.
