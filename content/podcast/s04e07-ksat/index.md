As a kid, I was always fascinated by space tech.
That fascination has only grown as I've learned more about the engineering challenges involved in space exploration.

In this episode, we talk to Vegard Sandengen, a Rust engineer at KSAT, a company that provides ground station services for satellites.
They use Rust to manage the data flow from hundreds of satellites, ensuring that data is received, processed, and stored efficiently.
This data is then made available to customers around the world, enabling them to make informed decisions based on real-time satellite data.
