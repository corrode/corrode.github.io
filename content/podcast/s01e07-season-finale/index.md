In the season finale of 'Rust in Production', we take a cold, hard look at our
goals and achievements during the first season.

Did we manage to answer the tough questions about Rust's usage in the industry?
Were we able to provide a balanced view of the challenges and benefits of using
Rust? Or did we end up merely preaching to the choir?

As it turns out, the answers align nicely with the main themes from the Rust
2023 survey: the hiring market, the learning curve, the reasons for choosing
Rust, the costs of adoption, and the complexity of the language. Either way,
there were definitely some surprises and unexpected turns along the way!
