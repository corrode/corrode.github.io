In this episode, we talk to Paul Dix, founder and CTO of
[InfluxData](https://www.influxdata.com/), about how they use Rust to build the
InfluxDB time series database and related products. We discuss the challenges of
building a database that scales to handle millions of writes per second, the
reasons for choosing Rust, and how Rust enables them to ship more reliable
software that customers can depend on.
