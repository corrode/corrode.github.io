Looks like you were looking for my YouTube channel, [Hello Rust!](https://www.youtube.com/c/HelloRust).

Running the show was a lot of fun, but I decided to stop it in 2021. I'm still
very much into Rust, but I want to focus on other things for now
like my consulting business, [corrode](https://corrode.dev) (that's the website
you're looking at right now).

Here are a few things that might be of interest to you:

- I'm open for consulting work. [Get in touch](/about) with me if you're interested.
- Want to read articles on idiomatic Rust? Check out my [article series](/blog).
- Find the original Hello Rust website [here](https://hello-rust.github.io).
- Want to start your own YouTube channel? Here are my [lessons learned](https://github.com/hello-rust/show/blob/master/LESSONS_LEARNED.md).
- For my personal projects, check out my [private blog](https://endler.dev).
- Check out my new podcast, "[Rust in Production](https://corrode.dev/podcast)."
