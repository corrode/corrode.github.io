Looks like you were looking for my YouTube channel [Hello Rust](https://www.youtube.com/c/HelloRust).

Running the show was a lot of fun, but I decided to stop it in 2021. I'm still
very much into Rust, but I want to focus on other things for now
like my consulting business, [corrode](https://corrode.dev) (that's the website
you're looking at right now).

Here are a few things that might interest you:

- Need help learning Rust? [Get in touch](/about) with me.
- Want to read articles on idiomatic Rust? Check out my [article series](/blog).
- If you want to visit the original Hello Rust website, you can find it [here](hello-rust.github.io).
- If you want to start your own YouTube channel, here are my [lessons learned](https://github.com/hello-rust/show/blob/master/LESSONS_LEARNED.md).
- For my personal projects, check out my [private blog](https://endler.dev).
- Or check out my new podcast, "[Rust in Production](https://corrode.dev/podcast)."
