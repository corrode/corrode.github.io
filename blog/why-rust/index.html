      <p>Interest in Rust has surged in recent years, with tech leaders such as
Microsoft, Google, and Amazon coming forward to share their experiences of
leveraging Rust for critical systems.</p>
<p>Much of the dialogue about Rust, however, is still driven by those who have not
leveraged Rust in a significant production capacity or have only done so for
non-critical systems. This results in a skewed understanding of Rust’s
application in production settings, especially for small and medium-sized
businesses, where discussions tend to highlight performance benefits and gloss
over other crucial aspects.</p>
<p>In my role as a Rust consultant, <a href="/podcast">I have had the opportunity to engage with many
companies, large and small</a>. I found that companies value Rust’s
stability, and long-term maintainability on par with its performance benefits.</p>
<p>This overview distills key insights, offering a resource for businesses to
assess whether Rust is the right tool for their use-case or not.</p>
<p>The intent is to provide an honest look at Rust’s practicality for production
to help decision-makers understand its benefits and challenges.</p>

<h3 id="reliability-and-stability"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#reliability-and-stability" aria-label="Anchor link for: reliability-and-stability">Reliability and Stability</a></h3>
<p>From experience, the majority of companies care less about uncompromising
performance and more about <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://talks.osfc.io/osfc2021/talk/JTWYEH/">reliability and
stability</a> of their services.</p>
<p>This is backed by the <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops/"><em>State of DevOps Report 2023</em></a>
by Google Cloud, which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reliability unlocks performance.</strong> […]
Strong reliability practices predict better operational performance, team
performance, and organizational performance. […]
Being able to operate the machine effectively allows teams to achieve more,
which allows organizations to thrive. - <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops/"><em>State of DevOps Report 2023</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>More predictable and stable services are easier to maintain and cheaper to
operate. Less time is spent on debugging and on-call, and more time on building
new features. Scaling services is also easier when you know how systems behave
under load.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given our small team size, infrastructure reliability is crucial, otherwise,
maintenance starves innovation. Rust provides us with confidence that any code
modification or refactor is likely to produce working programs that will run for
months with minimal supervision. - <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://x.ai/">xAI (formerly Twitter)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As another example, the npm registry migrated to Rust in 2019. (See their whitepaper
<a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.rust-lang.org/static/pdfs/Rust-npm-Whitepaper.pdf">here</a>.) As the
largest software registry in the world, it sees upwards of 1.3 billion package
downloads… <em>per day</em>. Npm is critical infrastructure for the JavaScript
ecosystem, and the stability of its services is paramount. This focus on
stability directly impacts the effectiveness and reliability of the entire
JavaScript ecosystem.</p>

Below is the relative cost of fixing bugs at various stages of the development lifecycle.
Bugs found in production are significantly more expensive to fix than bugs found
during development. (Source: NIST <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/director/planning/report02-3.pdf">Costs of Software Defects</a>)</p>

<p>In a survey, <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2019/07/a-proactive-approach-to-more-secure-code/">Microsoft found that 70% of their bugs are due to memory safety
issues</a>.
In 2018, the number of CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) at Microsoft
was 468. Each CVE costs an average of $150,000 to fix, which, as Microsoft
points out, is a very conservative estimate. (Source: <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQBVUjdkLAA&amp;t=1s">Ryan Levick - Rust at

Rust couldn’t have prevented all of these bugs, but it would have drastically
reduced the total amount.</p>
<p>Rust’s strong type system and its borrow checker allow you to <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://kerkour.com/bugs-rust-compiler-helps-prevent">catch bugs
earlier in the development lifecycle, typically at compile-time</a> (instead of
runtime as in languages with less stringent type systems or static analysis
capabilities). This results in real cost savings for companies.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>As requirements grow, Rust is a great language for building larger applications
that are maintained by a bigger team over a long period of time. This is due to
its strong type system, its focus on memory safety, its powerful tooling (cargo,
rustfmt, clippy, etc.) and its stability guarantees (backwards compatibility)
due to its edition system. All of that makes large-scale refactoring easier.</p>

<h3 id="predictable-runtime-behavior"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#predictable-runtime-behavior" aria-label="Anchor link for: predictable-runtime-behavior">Predictable Runtime Behavior</a></h3>
<p>Predictable runtime behavior is closely related to reliability and stability.
It means that services run smoothly without any hiccups. This is especially
important for latency-sensitive services like games, chat applications, or
services that need to act on real-time data.</p>
<p>Smooth operation is of uppermost importance for organizations as it is a
significant cost factor and can impact customer satisfaction. According to a

<p>Discord has a <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://discord.com/blog/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust">great
article</a>
about why they switched from Go to Rust. They mention that Go’s garbage
collector was a source of unpredictable latency spikes. After switching to Rust,
they were able to fully get rid of garbage collection and have a more
predictable runtime behavior.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we started load testing, we were instantly pleased with the results. The
latency of the Rust version was just as good as Go’s and had no latency spikes!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a diagram from the above article by Discord.
Notice how the latency spikes in the Go version (purple) are gone in the Rust
version (blue) and how that impacts the 95th percentile response time, making it
much more predictable and smooth.</p>
<img src="discord.png" alt="Discord Go (purple) vs Rust (blue)">
<p>Another example is
<a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/big-pineapple-intro/">Cloudflare</a>,
which uses Rust to power their DNS service, <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://1.1.1.1/">1.1.1.1</a>. They
mention that Rust’s predictable runtime behavior is a big reason for using it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the things we’ve learned with the previous implementations is that, for
a service open to the public, a peak performance of the I/O matters less than
the ability to pace clients fairly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Rust shows excellent runtime behavior when handling network requests.
In a <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/star-gazers/benchmarking-low-level-i-o-c-c-rust-golang-java-python-9a0d505f85f7">benchmark by Eugene Retunsky</a>, Rust had the lowest tail latency and maximum throughput next to C and C++.</p>
<p>Here is the diagram from the benchmark, showing the p99.9 latency for each
language under test. As the requests per second increase, the latency for Rust
stays low and stable. Go and Java on the other hand have a higher baseline
latency while Python shows latency spikes at a certain point.</p>
<img src="runtime.png" alt="Rust Runtime behavior">
<p>The author concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Rust has a much lower latency variance than Golang, Python, and especially Java.
[…] Rust might be a better alternative to Golang, Java, or Python if predictable performance is crucial for your service. Also, before starting to write a new service in C or C++, it’s worth considering Rust. - <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/star-gazers/benchmarking-low-level-i-o-c-c-rust-golang-java-python-9a0d505f85f7">Eugene Retunsky</a></p>

<h3 id="cost-savings"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#cost-savings" aria-label="Anchor link for: cost-savings">Cost Savings</a></h3>
<p>We touched on cost savings already, but its significance warrants a dedicated
section.</p>
<p>Rust has a low runtime overhead. This is especially important for services that
need to scale to handle a large number of requests.
It can save a lot of money on cloud infrastructure costs if the same workload
can be handled with fewer resources.</p>
<p>For example, AWS has a service called
<a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/firecracker-lightweight-virtualization-for-serverless-computing/">Firecracker</a>,
which runs virtual machines with very low overhead. It powers AWS Lambda functions and AWS Fargate containers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Firecracker consumes about 5 MiB of memory per microVM. You can run thousands
of secure VMs with widely varying vCPU and memory configurations on the same
instance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The better hardware utilization translates to lower costs for companies.</p>
<p>Firecracker allowed AWS to improve the efficiency of Fargate, which passed on
cost savings to customers. As a result, they were able to reduce the price of Fargate by
up to 50%.

<h3 id="ergonomics"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#ergonomics" aria-label="Anchor link for: ergonomics">Ergonomics</a></h3>
<p>Rust has great developer ergonomics. Its expressive type system allows
developers to model their domain in a way that lets the compiler help with
writing correct code.</p>
<p>Furthermore, functional concepts like pattern matching, enums, <code>Result</code> and <code>Option</code> types
allow for concise and expressive code.</p>
<p>Rust’s robust error handling story, which requires the programmer to explicitly handle
errors, is a big reason for its reliability.</p>
<p>All these features make it easier to write correct code, reduce the cognitive
load on developers and catch bugs at compile-time instead of runtime.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More than its memory safety and thread safety guarantees, the language exposes
facilities to library designers for building abstractions that resist misuse.
The emergent safe library ecosystem enables “if it compiles, then it’s correct”
programming unmatched by other mainstream languages, even garbage collected
ones. - <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://docs.rs/dtolnay/0.0.11/dtolnay/macro._03__soundness_bugs.html">David Tolnay, author of serde</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rust’s static analysis <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-left_testing">shifts the quality assurance of code to the
left</a>:</p>
<img src="robustness.svg" class="invert" alt="Bug detection over time">
<blockquote>
<p>Rust has been a force multiplier for our team, and betting on Rust was one of

<p>An often mentioned benefit of Rust is the possibility to refactor code without
fear. This should not be underestimated as it allows you to improve your
codebase over time and make it more robust. Especially for applications that use
multi-threading, this is a big advantage as <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/04/10/Fearless-Concurrency.html">typical error scenarios of

<p>Companies rarely rewrite their services in another language. It incurs a lot of costs
and risks. Only if a rewrite promises a <em>significant</em> upside, companies will
consider it.</p>
<p>One well-known company that started to heavily invest in Rust is Microsoft.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft is going big on Rust and spending $10 million to make it 1st class
language in our engineering systems + $1 million @rustlang foundation. - <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/dwizzzleMSFT/status/1720134540822520268">David Weston, Vice President of OS Security and Enterprise at Microsoft</a></p>

<p>Microsoft even <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/markrussinovich/status/1656416376125538304">integrated Rust into the Windows kernel</a>.
The fact that they take big bets on Rust shows that they are in it
for the long run. This is a good sign for the Rust ecosystem, as the backing of
a large company can help Rust to become more mainstream and ensure
long-term sustainability.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/rust/index.html">the Linux kernel now supports Rust</a>
as well.
The Kernel incorporating Rust is a major endorsement of the language. Notably,
the Linux Kernel maintainers have previously <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/c++/linus">refused to integrate C++ in the Kernel</a>.</p>
<p>In a landmark development for Rust, the open source <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/officially-qualified-ferrocene/">Ferrocene

environments like automotive or avionics. Few other languages have
achieved this level of certification. It is another strong signal that Rust is
here to stay.</p>

<p>As stated earlier, performance often gets mentioned as a main reason for using Rust.
On top of that, Rust has great support for multi-threaded workloads. Libraries like
<a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon">rayon</a> and <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://tokio.rs/">Tokio</a> are considered
best-in-class for writing high-performance applications.</p>
<p>Making efficient use of compute resources has much deeper implications for
companies than just raw execution speed.</p>
<p>One important aspect is scalability: companies can defer costly performance optimizations
and scaling efforts by choosing a language that is efficient by default. This way, they
can focus on building features and growing their business before they need to worry about
performance bottlenecks.</p>
<p>In his talk at FrOSCon 2024, <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kerkmann">Daniél Kerkmann</a>, software engineer at
<a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://opentalk.eu">OpenTalk</a> – a secure video conferencing platform written in Rust – shared that
sentiment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The performance of Rust kept us afloat for a long time.</strong></p>
<p>Up to a point of 10.000 video participants we didn’t have to refactor thanks to Rust’s performance.
We could focus on features instead without worrying about bottlenecks.<br />

<p>Another aspect of performance is energy efficiency.</p>
<p>In the below benchmark, taken from <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://greenlab.di.uminho.pt/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sleFinal.pdf">“Energy Efficiency across Programming Languages”</a>

<p>One often overlooked aspect of Rust is that it can be incrementally integrated
into existing codebases. Interoperability is a key concern of Rust, allowing it
to <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/tips-and-experiences-integrating-rust-into-other-projects/12091/12">natively interface with other languages like C, C++, or Python</a>.</p>
<p>This makes it possible for Rust to take on a supporting role in existing
codebases, where it can be used for security- or performance-critical parts
while the rest of the codebase remains in the original language. <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l--5nx_q0_Y">This greatly
reduces risks as big rewrites are avoided.</a></p>
<p>In a data science environment dominated by Python, integrating Rust offers
significant performance enhancements.
By using Rust to process data originally managed with Python libraries such as
Pandas and NumPy, data can be strategically copied from Python into Rust
structures, and leveraging Rust’s powerful concurrency tools like Rayon for
parallel processing.</p>
<p>As a case-study, this approach, <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/1faOd6KH-w4?si=pdd04RikPpsohiza&amp;t=1111">significantly accelerated a critical data
processing task at
Vortexa</a>, which wrote a
Python extension in Rust to optimize the performance of a hot path in their data
processing pipeline. The result was a reduction from 24 hours to 1 hour with 400
lines of Rust code. The rest of the codebase remained intact.</p>
<p>It shows Rust’s potential to serve as a <em>surgical tool</em> within other ecosystems,
dramatically optimizing performance with minimal intrusion.</p>
<p>On top of that, the Rust library code could be reused across projects from
embedded programs to cloud services, which streamlines the development process
and further reduces maintenance costs.</p>

<p>For companies with diverse product portfolios,
it can be beneficial to have a single language that can be used across the

different contexts, reducing boundaries between teams and making it easier to
share code.</p>

<p>Every technology comes with its own set of challenges, and Rust is no exception.
The following points highlight some common concerns about using Rust in
production. You need to weigh them against the benefits discussed earlier to
make an informed decision for your team.</p>
<h3 id="immature-ecosystem"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#immature-ecosystem" aria-label="Anchor link for: immature-ecosystem">Immature ecosystem</a></h3>
<p>Rust is a relatively young language. Version 1.0 was first released in 2015.
This means that the ecosystem is still maturing. Many important libraries <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/11byl6u/why_is_every_crate_pre10/">did not see their 1.0 release yet</a>.</p>
<p>This phenomenon has been <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/11byl6u/why_is_every_crate_pre10/ja3auop/">brought up as a reason to be cautious when using Rust in production</a>.</p>
<p>In practice, it might be hard to find production-grade libraries for specific
needs. Your team might be required to write custom crates or improve existing
ones. Furthermore, <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/explore?ecosystem=RUST">sponsoring open source maintainers</a> to work on critical
dependencies is a good way to ensure that the long-term sustainability of the
ecosystem.</p>
<p>That said, libraries for common tasks like JSON parsing or network handling are
very robust and stable and considered best-in-class. Breaking changes are rare
and important crates like <code>serde</code> or <code>tokio</code> are already past their 1.0 release.</p>
<p>A relatively recent addition to the Rust ecosystem is async/await support, a
feature designed to streamline the writing of concurrent applications. This support
represents a significant evolution in Rust’s capabilities, but it is still
in its early stages.
If you’re planning to write network applications in Rust, there is a high chance
that you will need to use async/await. As such it’s important to stay on top of
its ongoing development and limitations. For a detailed exploration of where
async/await in Rust stands today, including its practical implications, we
invite you to read our comprehensive post detailing the current <a href="/blog/async/">state of

<h3 id="lack-of-developers"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#lack-of-developers" aria-label="Anchor link for: lack-of-developers">Lack Of Developers</a></h3>
<p>Related to the previous point, the Rust community is still relatively small.
It is hard to find developers with professional Rust experience.</p>
<p>From talking to companies that use Rust in production, I found that they are
mostly training their developers on the job.
Moreover, Rust is noted for enabling a smooth onboarding process for engineers
already proficient in languages like C++ or Java.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Rust developers are generally very passionate about their
craft and are actively seeking out jobs that allow them to use Rust,
so the market for Rust developers is growing. (Also see
the previous section about developer happiness.)</p>

Debugging support is still lacking, but it is <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/debugging-support-in-rustc.html">steadily improving</a>.
<a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2021/rust/#Rust_what-profiling-tools-do-you-use-for-rust">The story for profiling support is similar.</a>
It should be noted, that Rust integrates well with existing tools like <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://blog.logrocket.com/debugging-rust-apps-with-gdb/">GDB</a> or
perf, although <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues/2838">the experience is not seamless on all platforms yet</a>.

<p>Recently, <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/">JetBrains announced RustRover</a>,
a new IDE for Rust which is based on IntelliJ.
This is a strong signal that JetBrains sees it as a good investment to build

<h3 id="learning-curve"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#learning-curve" aria-label="Anchor link for: learning-curve">Learning Curve</a></h3>
<p>Rust has a <a href="/blog/flattening-rusts-learning-curve/">famously steep learning curve</a>. It is a complex language with many
advanced features.</p>
<p>When asked why they don’t use Rust, participants of the <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/08/07/Rust-Survey-2023-Results.html#rust-usage">2022 Annual Rust Survey</a>
mentioned the learning curve as the main reason:</p>
<img src="why-not-rust.svg" class="invert" alt="Why not Rust?">
<p>In the <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/12/16/rust-survey-2020.html#improved-learnability">Rust 2020
survey</a>,
participants were asked to rate the difficulty of various Rust concepts. Here
are the results:</p>
<img src="topic-difficulty-ratings.svg" class="invert" alt="Difficulty by topic">
<p>Lifetime annotations, ownership, and borrowing were mentioned as the most
difficult topics to grasp. In real-world applications, lifetimes
are less of an issue, however, as the compiler can often infer them through
<a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/lifetime-elision.html">lifetime elision</a>.
Ownership and borrowing however are crucial concepts in Rust that need to be
understood to become proficient.</p>
<p>It is important to set clear expectations for your team when adopting Rust: Rust
is not a language that you can learn in a few days. It requires practice to internalize
the concepts around ownership and borrowing to become productive with it.</p>
<p>There is an upfront cost of learning the language and training your team with
the expectation that it will pay off in the long run.</p>
<p>The time to become productive with Rust varies. Google’s experience suggests:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on our studies, more than 2/3 of respondents are confident in
contributing to a Rust codebase within two months or less when learning Rust.
Further, a third of respondents become as productive using Rust as other
languages in two months or less. <strong>Within four months, that number increased to
over 50%.</strong> - <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/06/rust-fact-vs-fiction-5-insights-from-googles-rust-journey-2022.html">Google</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Microsoft also shared a <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2020/04/the-safety-boat-kubernetes-and-rust/">similar experience</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>It takes several weeks of hard effort</strong> learning how to code properly in Rust
before the learning curve levels out. However, that hard effort up front pays
off in dividends due to the aforementioned safety features. We also noticed that
once developers are over that initial curve, they are able to contribute to code
just as easily as with any other language. Just be aware that there will be some
initial pain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depending on your immediate needs, this might be a deal-breaker for your team.
Other languages like Go or Python have a much lower learning curve and are
a better fit for rapid prototyping.
<a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://mdwdotla.medium.com/using-rust-at-a-startup-a-cautionary-tale-42ab823d9454">Think twice before adopting it in a fast-paced startup
environment</a>
, particularly if your team doesn’t include seasoned Rust developers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assuming you’re building a product in the right domain for Rust […], even
then the answer is not clear-cut. […] Development velocity and being able to
make rapid iterations is so important for an early stage startup that it
outweighs a lot of the benefits that Rust brings to the table. -

</blockquote>
<h3 id="compile-times"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#compile-times" aria-label="Anchor link for: compile-times">Compile Times</a></h3>
<p>Rust has a reputation for having long compile times. This is especially true for
large projects with many dependencies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Slow build speeds were by far the #1 reported challenge that developers have
when using Rust, with only a little more than 40% of respondents finding the
speed acceptable. - <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/06/rust-fact-vs-fiction-5-insights-from-googles-rust-journey-2022.html">Google</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rapid iteration is important for developers. Long compile times can be a
productivity killer. This is most noticeable for developers that are used to
languages like Go or Python, where the feedback loop is much faster.</p>
<p>Compile times are a known issue and the Rust team is <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://nnethercote.github.io/2023/03/24/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-in-march-2023.html">continously working on improving them</a>.
And these incremental improvements are paying off. The Rust compiler is getting
faster over time. For example, the Rust compiler is twice as fast than it was in
2018 for <code>cargo check</code> (which is the most common command to quickly check
for errors):</p>
<img src="compile-times.svg" class="invert" alt="Rust Compile Times Over Time">
<p>Very recently, the Rust compiler frontend also gained support for <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/11/09/parallel-rustc.html">parallel
compilation</a>, which
could drastically reduce compile times for large projects. The feature is
currently in <em>nightly</em> only and highly experimental, but it promises speedups
of up to 50%. Details on how to test it can be found in the announcement
<a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/11/09/parallel-rustc.html">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>For more advice on how to improve compile times, see <a href="/blog/tips-for-faster-rust-compile-times/">my article on this
topic</a> with many practical tips.
For medium-sized projects, compile times are less of an issue. <a class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/qgi421/doing_m1_macbook_pro_m1_max_64gb_compile/">Modern hardware

<h2 id="conclusion"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-label="Anchor link for: conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Rust is a great language for building large-scale, reliable, and stable
applications. It is a good fit for companies that value productivity and
developer happiness and see it as a long-term investment.</p>
<p>On the other side, Rust is still a young language and the ecosystem is still
maturing. It has a steep learning curve and long compile times.</p>
<p>These challenges are not insurmountable, however. They require a commitment to
Rust and a willingness to invest in training and tooling.</p>
<p>Navigating the decision to integrate Rust into your technology stack is pivotal
and requires thoughtful consideration. Should you find yourself weighing its
benefits against your specific requirements, professional guidance can prove
invaluable. Equally, if you are ready to embrace Rust and are seeking expertise
in training or consulting to ensure a smooth transition, specialized support is
essential.</p>
