        If you made it this far, I bet you'll like my future articles, too.
        <strong>Sign up and we'll be best friends forever.</strong> I'll send you updates on my latest
        articles and projects, and you have someone you can pair-program with. It will be great.
        We should go watch a movie together sometime. üçø
