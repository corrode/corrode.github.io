As we approach the finale of our second season, it's time for another recap.
<p>Could we shed some light on the current state of Rust’s usage in the industry?
What has changed in our perception of Rust in production since our last season?</p>
<p>While more companies started to embrace Rust, some of the magic of Rust’s early days is gone.
I expect more ripple effects as the community clashes with the industry’s demands.</p>
<p>This episode takes on a more somber tone, as we peer into the massive tech debt we have accumulated as an industry.
And in the dark: a faint glow, a narrow golden path that points us towards a more hopeful future.</p>

<h4 id="if-you-could-change-one-thing-about-the-rust-in-production-podcast-what-would-it-be-and-why">If you could change one thing about the “Rust in Production” podcast, what would it be and why?</h4>
<p>We received 20 unique responses. Top 5 key insights:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>More technical focus:</strong> Many listeners expressed a desire for more in-depth technical discussions rather than high-level or business-oriented content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved audio quality:</strong> Some mentioned that the audio can be hard to hear at times and suggested better audio production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diversity in guests:</strong> There’s a request for more diverse guests, including women and people from atypical backgrounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tighter editing:</strong> Some listeners feel the discussions can ramble and could benefit from more focused editing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Format variations:</strong> Suggestions include offering video versions, having occasional casual discussions with a co-host on ecosystem topics, and potentially shortening episode lengths.</p>
