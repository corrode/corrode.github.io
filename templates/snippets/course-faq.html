          Do I need prior programming experience?
        </summary>
        <p>
          You don't need any prior Rust experience. However, you should be
          familiar with another programming language like Python, JavaScript,
          Java, C, C++, etc. Our courses are structured to assist beginners,
          especially in our "Learning Rust by Counting Words" course.
