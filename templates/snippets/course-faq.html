          Do I need any prior programming experience?
        </summary>
        <p>
          For the beginner course you don't need any prior Rust experience.
          However, you should be familiar with another programming language like
          Python, JavaScript, Java, C, C++, etc. For the advanced course you
          should have a good understanding of the Rust basics and be familiar
          with the Rust ecosystem.

          Yes, you get a certificate of completion after finishing a course. The
          certificate mentions the course name, the level, the duration of the
          course, your name, and the date of completion. You can use the
          certificate to present to your employer or add to your resume.
