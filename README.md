# corrode Rust Consulting

We might not know each other yet, but I'm excited to meet you!
I'm [Matthias Endler](https://endler.dev), a Rust consultant and trainer.

I've been working with Rust since 2015 and I've been consulting since 2020.
My specialty is helping companies to adopt Rust and integrate it into their
existing codebase.

Check out my [consulting page](https://corrode.dev) for more details.
This is the source code of that website. ðŸ¦€
